Xamarin apps look and feel native because they are.


Native User Interfaces
Xamarin apps are built with standard, native user interface controls. Apps not only look the way the end user expects, they behave that way too.


Native API Access
Xamarin apps have access to the full spectrum of functionality exposed by the underlying platform and device, including platform-specific capabilities like iBeacons and Android Fragments.


Native Performance
Xamarin apps leverage platform-specific hardware acceleration, and are compiled for native performance. This can’t be achieved with solutions that interpret code at runtime.


C# is the best language for mobile app development.
Anything you can do in Objective-C, Swift or Java, you can do in C#.


More Types, Less Typing
C# uses type inference to give developers more safety in fewer keystrokes, without boilerplate or verbose type annotations


Language-level Async
Asynchronous programming (async) keeps apps responsive. In Objective-C, Swift and Java, async requires callbacks and manual bookkeeping. C#’s language-level support makes async a breeze


Stronger Types, Smarter Tools
Generics guarantee that collections and other compound types are used safely, without the need for casts or comments. Xamarin tools understand intent better thanks to richer types, with benefits like ubiquitous code completion.


First-class Functions
In Java for Android, lambdas are unavailable. In Objective-C, lambdas are extremely cumbersome. In C#, lambdas couldn’t be simpler, making functional programmers feel right at home.


Native user interfaces, built right before your eyes.
Xamarin apps use native UIs on every platform to enable the best possible experiences. Simplify mobile app design with our Android and iOS designers, and build your own app today.


Share code everywhere.
Use the same language, APIs and data structures to share an average of 75% of app code across all mobile development platforms. Build user interfaces with Xamarin.Forms and share nearly 100%.


Shared Projects
Add any file to a Shared Project and it’s automatically included on all platforms. Share code, images, and any other media across iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.


Portable Class Libraries
Use popular Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) like SQLite, Json.NET, or ReactiveUI on every platform. Build your own app logic as a PCL and use it everywhere.


Xamarin.Forms
Xamarin.Forms allows you to build native user interfaces for iOS, Android and Windows Phone using 100% shared C#. Xamarin.Forms includes more than 40 controls and layouts, which are mapped to native controls at runtime.


Xamarin.iOS
The best way to build native iOS apps.


Ship native app bundles on the App Store. Our Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler compiles Xamarin.iOS apps directly to native ARM assembly code, meaning your app is a native platform binary.
Access any iOS API. We bring 100% of Apple’s iOS SDK to C#, enhancing Objective-C APIs with stronger types and .NET naming conventions so you feel right at home.
Call existing Objective-C code from C#. Use your existing Objective-C code, frameworks, and custom controls in your Xamarin app using our automatic binding generator.
Build WatchKit apps. Use Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio to build new Watch Apps, edit Watch user interfaces in the iOS Designer, and debug Watch apps in the iOS Simulator.
Stay up-to-date with Apple. We released same-day support for iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, and iOS 8 so your apps can take advantage of the latest iOS features as soon as possible.


Xamarin.Android
The best way to build native Android apps.


Nexus 6 and Moto 360 running Xamarin apps
Ship native Android packages. Xamarin.Android uses just-in-time compilation for sophisticated runtime optimization of your app’s performance, meaning your app is a native Android APK.
Access any Android API, including new form factors. We bring 100% of Google’s Android APIs to C#, enhancing Java APIs with async support and .NET naming conventions so you feel right at home.
Call existing Java code from C#. Use your existing Java code, frameworks, and custom controls in your Xamarin app using our automatic binding generator.
Build Android Wear apps. With access to 100% API support for Android Wear, create full-featured applications capable of running on Android Wear devices.
Stay up-to-date with Android. Xamarin stays up-to-date with the most current APIs from Google, so you can always use the latest features in your apps.


Bring your apps to 66 million Macs.
Bring your mobile and Windows apps to Mac.
Whether you’re creating a companion desktop application for a mobile app, or bringing a Windows application to the Mac, Xamarin.Mac is the fastest path to your destination.


Use AppKit with Interface Builder.
Use XCode's Interface Builder to design your Mac app visually, then program your AppKit UI while sharing C# with iOS, Android and even Windows.


A rich and interactive way to explore Xamarin.
Discover a new way to learn iOS, Mac and Android development as well as a fast way to explore new APIs and iterate on features without having to first build and run a project. Sketches display code executing in real-time right from your IDE, and are ideal for experimenting with new language features, exploring APIs, developing algorithms and more.


Finish your app faster with NuGet and Xamarin Plugins.
Add high-quality components to your app directly from your IDE, including controls, web service APIs and more. Integrate popular backends such as Microsoft Azure, Parse, Salesforce, and SAP. Add powerful security features such as authentication and encryption.


Write C#. Run on 2.6 billion devices.
With C# and Visual Studio, you can share the same code on iOS, Android, Windows, Mac and more.

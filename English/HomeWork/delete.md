Computers for the disabled
{X}

Computers have taken a dominant role in our society,
meaning most jobs now require access to computers and
the Internet. But what happens if a person is blind, deaf or
motor-disabled? They needn't worry. The latest assistive
technology is designed to help them use computers and do
their jobs in the office, learn at school, or interact with their
families at home. In addition, new laws oblige companies
to adapt the workplace to accommodate disabled people.
For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
and the UK's Disability Discrimination Act make it illegal for
employers to discriminate against people with disabilities.

To work effectively, most blind users need to have their
computers adapted with technologies such as Braille,
screen magnifiers, speech synthesis and Optical
Character Recognition (OCR).

Braille keyboards have Braille lettering on keyboard
overlays, allowing the blind user to easily identify each key.
For output, there are printers, called Braille embossers, that
produce tactile Braille symbols on both sides of a page at
high speed.

For someone with limited but usable vision, a screen
magnifier may be appropriate. This type of software can
enlarge text and images appearing on the screen by up to
16 times.

A Braille embosser prints a hard copy of a text document in Braille

A speech synthesis system is used to read aloud the work on
the computer. It has a speech synthesizer, which produces
the audio output, and a screen reader - the program which
reads aloud text and menus from word processors, databases
and the Web.

OCR uses a flatbed scanner and specialized OCR software to
read printed material and send the text to the computer. The
PC can then produce a copy of the text in Braille, a magnified
copy, or a version that can be read aloud by a speech
synthesis system.

Deaf computer users can overcome many
communication difficulties with the aid of visual alerts,
electronic notetakers and textphones. Visual alerts are
indicators that alert the deaf user when they receive new
mail or when there is a system error. So instead of hearing
a sound, the user is alerted by a blinking menu bar or by a
message on the screen. Electronic notetakers use software
that types a summary of what is said in meetings onto the
computer screen.

Textphones allow the deaf to type and read phone
conversations. They are also called TDDs (Telephone
Devices for the Deaf) or TTYs (TeleTypewriters). They
can be used in combination with relay services, where
an operator says what the text user types, and types
what a voice phone user says. Deaf people can also
communicate via SMS and instant messaging.

Motor-impaired workers unable to type on a standard
keyboard can employ expanded or ergonomic
keyboards, on-screen keyboards, adaptive switches
and voice recognition systems

{X}
On-screen keyboards are software images of a keyboard
that appear on the screen and may be activated with a
trackball, touch screen, screen-pointing device, or eye
movements. In an eyegaze system, the keys on the
virtual keyboard are activated by the user's eyes when
they pause on a key for two or three seconds.

{X}
Eyegaze technology consists of a video
camera and image processing software, which
determines the eye's gazepoint on the screen

Switches come in many shapes and sizes. They are
operated by muscle movements or breath control. For
example, a pneumatic switch - known as a sip and puff
- allows someone with quadriplegia to control the PC by
puffing and sipping air through a pneumatic tube. People
with quadriplegia can also use sip and puff joysticks.

Finally, there's voice recognition, which allows the
computer to interpret human speech, transforming the
words into digitized text or instructions

Computers for the disabled

Computers have taken a dominant role in our society,meaning most jobs now require access to computers andthe Internet. But what happens if a person is blind, deaf ormotor-disabled? They needn't worry. The latest assistivetechnology is designed to help them use computers and dotheir jobs in the office, learn at school, or interact with theirfamilies at home. In addition, new laws oblige companiesto adapt the workplace to accommodate disabled people.For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)and the UK's Disability Discrimination Act make it illegal foremployers to discriminate against people with disabilities.

To work effectively, most blind users need to have theircomputers adapted with technologies such as Braille,screen magnifiers, speech synthesis and OpticalCharacter Recognition (OCR).

Braille keyboards have Braille lettering on keyboardoverlays, allowing the blind user to easily identify each key.For output, there are printers, called Braille embossers, thatproduce tactile Braille symbols on both sides of a page athigh speed.

For someone with limited but usable vision, a screenmagnifier may be appropriate. This type of software canenlarge text and images appearing on the screen by up to16 times.

A Braille embosser prints a hard copy of a text document in Braille

A speech synthesis system is used to read aloud the work onthe computer. It has a speech synthesizer, which producesthe audio output, and a screen reader - the program whichreads aloud text and menus from word processors, databasesand the Web.

OCR uses a flatbed scanner and specialized OCR software toread printed material and send the text to the computer. ThePC can then produce a copy of the text in Braille, a magnifiedcopy, or a version that can be read aloud by a speechsynthesis system.

Deaf computer users can overcome manycommunication difficulties with the aid of visual alerts,electronic notetakers and textphones. Visual alerts areindicators that alert the deaf user when they receive newmail or when there is a system error. So instead of hearinga sound, the user is alerted by a blinking menu bar or by amessage on the screen. Electronic notetakers use softwarethat types a summary of what is said in meetings onto thecomputer screen.

Textphones allow the deaf to type and read phoneconversations. They are also called TDDs (TelephoneDevices for the Deaf) or TTYs (TeleTypewriters). Theycan be used in combination with relay services, wherean operator says what the text user types, and typeswhat a voice phone user says. Deaf people can alsocommunicate via SMS and instant messaging.

Motor-impaired workers unable to type on a standardkeyboard can employ expanded or ergonomickeyboards, on-screen keyboards, adaptive switchesand voice recognition systems

On-screen keyboards are software images of a keyboardthat appear on the screen and may be activated with atrackball, touch screen, screen-pointing device, or eyemovements. In an eyegaze system, the keys on thevirtual keyboard are activated by the user's eyes whenthey pause on a key for two or three seconds.

Eyegaze technology consists of a videocamera and image processing software, whichdetermines the eye's gazepoint on the screen

Switches come in many shapes and sizes. They areoperated by muscle movements or breath control. Forexample, a pneumatic switch - known as a sip and puff- allows someone with quadriplegia to control the PC bypuffing and sipping air through a pneumatic tube. Peoplewith quadriplegia can also use sip and puff joysticks.

Finally, there's voice recognition, which allows thecomputer to interpret human speech, transforming thewords into digitized text or instructions
